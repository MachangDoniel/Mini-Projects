I'm Doniel Tripura, currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. I'm deeply into competitive programming in cpp, tackling challenges on platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, Atcoder, Leetcode, and Lightoj. Python is my go-to language, and I also work on development projects spanning SwiftUI, Android, Laravel, raw PHP, and more. My thesis focuses on Machine Learning.
